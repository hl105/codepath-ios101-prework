# App Brainstorming.

- `Instagram`:
    - `stories` feature that disappears after 24 hours
    - `explore` page where I can find new content creators to follow
    - `direct messaging` where I can message my friends
- `Spotify`:
    - `artist Profile` page where I can find all past albums of an artist
    - `user Profile` with my top songs of the month
    - `AI Generated Playlist` that fits my taste
- `Google Maps`:
    - `Get Current Location` to easily figure out where I am
    - `direction` when I tilt my phone, it shows which direction I'm pointing to
    - `ratings` for restaurants and `reviews`

# App Idea
- `study app` that you can use with your friends
- `finance app` where you can easily track your spendings
- `ai chatbot app` where you can create stories with chatbots
